"# Cherwell-Questionnaire" The solution is implemeneted by considering the top-left vertex as (0,0), top-right vertex as (0,60), bottom -right vertex as (60,60) and bottom-left vertex as (60,0). It has been developed as a C# web api endpoint and the front-end is developed in C# as well. To run the application: Please download Visual Studio 2017. Download Cherwell zipped folder. Unzip the folder contents. Open the CherwellQuestionnaire.sln file. Go to Debug Menu --> Start Debugging or Start without Debugging. Alternatively, you can even press Cntrl+F5 from the keyboard and the website will be launched in the local host. There by, you can follow the links that were present on the home page for the required solutions. Please refer Cherwell Solution.JPG file for my interpretation in developing the solution.
